# Glucoduino CSR Chip

This code is for an Arduino running the [Glucoduino](https://github.com/bentrevett/Glucoduino) code adapted for the CSR Bluetooth chip. 

It requires the [CSR uEnergy Software Development Kit (SDK)](http://www.csr.com/products/csr-energy-software-development-kit-sdk) and the [CSR BLE application](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ble-apps/id826487282). 

An example for using the CSR chip has been created - https://github.com/bentrevett/Glucoduino-CSR-Example - the ['Time' library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html) is requied for Unix time conversion.

## Notes

Has only been tested on CSR SDK version 2.2.
